xml-security-c (1.7.2-1) experimental; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
    - The attempted fix to address CVE-2013-2154 introduced the
      possibility of a heap overflow, possibly leading to arbitrary code
      execution, in the processing of malformed XPointer expressions in
      the XML Signature Reference processing code.  Fix that heap
      overflow.  (Closes: #714241, CVE-2013-2210)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Jun 2013 13:00:54 -0700

xml-security-c (1.7.1-1) experimental; urgency=high

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix a spoofing vulnerability that allows an attacker to reuse
      existing signatures with arbitrary content.  (CVE-2013-2153)
    - Fix a stack overflow in the processing of malformed XPointer
      expressions in the XML Signature Reference processing code.
      (CVE-2013-2154)
    - Fix processing of the output length of an HMAC-based XML Signature
      that could cause a denial of service when processing specially
      chosen input.  (CVE-2013-2155)
    - Fix a heap overflow in the processing of the PrefixList attribute
      optionally used in conjunction with Exclusive Canonicalization,
      potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2013-2156)
    - Reduce entity expansion limits when parsing.
    - New --id option to the xenc-checksig utility.
  * Rename the binaries in the xml-security-c-utils package to start with
    xsec-* instead of xmlsec-*.  This reflects the common abbreviation
    used by the package.

xml-security-c (1.7.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - AES-GCM support.
    - XML Encryption 1.1 OAEP enhancements.
  * Increase versioned dependency on libssl-dev to ensure that we have
    AES-GCM support.  (This only matters for backports to squeeze.)
  * Mark libxml-security-c-dev as Multi-Arch: same.
  * Add new xml-security-c-utils package that contains the utility
    programs included with the library.  Rename the binaries to add
    "xmlsec-" to the beginning of the names, since some of the programs
    are otherwise rather generic.  Add man pages for each of the programs.
    (Closes: #682830)
  * Switch from autotools-dev to dh-autoreconf and regenerate the entire
    build system during the build, not just the config.guess and
    config.sub scripts, and add --as-needed.
  * Add -fPIE to hardening flags since we're now installing binaries.
  * Move single-debian-patch to local-options and patch-header to
    local-patch-header so that they only apply to the packages built from
    the canonical Git repository and NMUs get regular version-numbered
    patches.
  * Switch to xz compression for *.debian.tar and the *.deb packages.
  * Use canonical URLs for Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Git.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.4.
    - Update debian/copyright to specify copyright-format 1.0.

    - Memory bug inside XENCCipherImpl::deSerialise

xml-security-c (1.6.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force build dependency on libssl-dev 1.0 or later for consistent build
    results.  If some Shibboleth-related libraries are built against
    earlier versions of libssl, it produces linking failures when building
    the Shibboleth SP package.
  * Stop running autoreconf during the build.  Upstream now ships
    sufficiently new generated files, and we no longer patch configure.
    Remove the associated build dependencies and extra clean files.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.2 (no changes required).

    - Support debugging of Reference/SignedInfo data
    - Add methods for Reference removal to DSIGSignature and
      DSIGSignedInfo classes
    - Lots of various bug fixes
  * Add build dependency on pkg-config, which upstream now uses to find
    the SSL libraries.
  * Remove --with-xerces from the configure flags, since "yes" is
    interpreted as a path to libraries and headers.
  * Remove unnecessary --with-openssl from configure flags.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V8.
    - Use the autotools-dev debhelper module for config.{sub,guess}.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization.
    - Move files to clean into a separate clean control file.
  * Use autoreconf instead of running the tools separately.
  * Update package home page for new upstream location.
  * Update package long description for the new official upstream name.
  * Update debian/copyright to the current DEP-5 specification.
  * Install the upstream NOTICE.txt file.
  * Change to Debian source format 3.0 (quilt).  Force a single Debian
    patch for simplicity since the packaging is maintained in Git using
    branches, and include a patch header explaining why.
  * debian/watch fixes for upstream distribution and versioning.
    - Mangle a tilde into upstream rc version numbers.
    - Update the upstream distribution URL.
    - Avoid matching signature and checksum files.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.1 (no changes required).

    - Rename library package for upstream SONAME bump.
  * Upstream now ships an older version of libtool, so run libtoolize and
    aclocal before the build.  Add build dependencies on automake and
    libtool.
  * Build against Xerces-C 3.0.
  * Stop building against Xalan.  The Xalan packages for Debian have been
    orphaned, the current Xalan release does not support Xerces-C 3.0, and
    porting it is not trivial.

    - Fix memory leaks in OpenSSL wrapping code.
    - Provide ability for calling application to define whether references
      are interlocking.
    - Complete implementation of XKMS message set
    - Methods to allow loading of encrypted data without doing decrypt
      and to process a decrypt/encrypt operation without replacing the

  * Include Xalan support.
  * Only include the major library version in the SONAME, not the minor
    library version.  The minor version corresponds to patch releases,
    which shouldn't break the ABI.
  * Package library documentation as libxml-security-c-doc.
  * Minor improvements to package descriptions.  Add homepage links.
  * Pre-create the library directory in debian/rules rather than via a
    patch.
  * Switch to quilt as the patch system.
  * Update config.guess and config.sub.
  * Change priority to extra.
  * General cleanup of debian/rules.
    - Remove commented-out and unused code.
    - Add build-arch and build-indep targets, just in case.
    - Run make distclean, not clean, and check its error status.
    - Always pass the host type into configure.
  * Include NOTICE text in debian/copyright rather than installing NOTICE,
    and include an explicit copyright statement and a license for the
    Debian packaging modifications.
  * Don't install CHANGELOG.txt twice or KEYS at all.
  * Remove unnecessary dh_installdirs invocation.
  * Install whole directories rather than wildcards in *.install files.
  * Remove commented-out samples from debian/watch.
  * Update to standards version 3.7.2 (no changes required).
